                                PyCon India is the largest annual conference for the community using and developing the Python programming language in India. It attracts the best Python programmers across the country and abroad. PyCon India is a community conference, organized by volunteers. Formally it is run by the Python Software Society of India, which is a non-profit society under Indian law.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h3>
                                Sponsoring
                            </h3>

                            <p>
                                Your sponsorship keeps PyCon India affordable to the widest possible audience.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to ensure a successful conference, the community needs to address a wide range of logistical and organizational challenges. PyCon India attendees sometimes require assistance with expenses especially student attendees, and sponsorship enables us to support those who would otherwise be unable to attend.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The attendees of PyCon India will include professional developers from large enterprises and smaller firms as well as people from academia. Delegates come to present their latest developments. With Python already becoming a major enterprise programming language and platform, sponsoring PyCon India 2017 is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate industry leadership in this part of the world. The attendance of PyCon India 2017 is expected to be between 1200 and 1350 delegates.

                        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

                                <a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is a community event. Here each and every task is done by a volunteer. And here is the opportunity for You to be a part of the community.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But before you register to volunteer, there are few things you should be aware of -
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Volunteering takes time and effort, sometimes a lot of it. For online activities like handling social networks or handling registrations etc take a lot of time. And sometimes rapid decisions have to be made. So if you're volunteering, make sure you have the time. If you're unavailable at certain time period of the day, let us know beforehand.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        If you're volunteering for offline activities e.g. on spot registration or settings up stages or handling video recording, anything that has to be done on the venue during the event, there is a good chance that you won't be able to attend the sessions you just registered for. If someone needs you, you have to be there.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Volunteering is not a free way into the event. At PyCon India, everybody buys tickets. Even the event organizers buy tickets. We volunteer because we love Python and PyCon, and want the event to be awesome.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Volunteers are the most important part of the event. Without the volunteers, the event cannot happen. So even if you are attending PyCon for the first time, we encourage you to volunteer with whatever you can. If you don't want to miss any sessions, then volunteer for smaller tasks.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                            <span><b>Q. I am a speaker/volunteer at the conference. Do I need to buy a ticket?</b><br></span> <span>A. Yes. At PyCon India, everybody buys tickets. Even the event organizers buy tickets. Your ticket helps keep the event affordable for all.</span>

                            <span><b>Q. Will the Internet and WiFi setup be good enough for a large crowd? Should I get a datacard?</b><br></span> <span>A. We try really hard to arrange good Internet at the venue. Most of the times it is adequate. But the unpredictable amount of usage during the event sometimes causes some problems. So it is fine if you don’t carry a data card, but there is no harm in being prepared for the worst.</span>
